Hi, I’m @athilt
I’m currently learning React.js user interface. To this end, I made a curriculu-management application. It is still very much
in development. It consists of two projects:

**curriculum**, the React GUI
- bootstrap

**boot1**, the Spring boot server
- maven
- mariadb
- liquibase
- REST with HAL
